Here, we found novel protein-protein interactions between PARP1 and DNA translocases, including HLTF, SHPRH, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1, with HLTF showing the strongest interaction among these DNA translocases. Although HLTF and SHPRH share structural and functional similarity, it remains unclear whether SHPRH contains DNA translocase activity. We further identified the ability of SHPRH to restrain DNA replication upon replication stress, indicating that SHPRH itself could be a DNA translocase or a helper to facilitate DNA translocation. Although hydroxyurea (HU) and MMS induce different types of replication stress, they both induce common DNA replication restraint mechanisms independent of intra-S phase activation. Our results suggest that the PARP1 facilitates DNA translocase recruitment to damaged forks, preventing fork collapse and facilitating DNA repair.\\nAuthor summary: Replication stress induces genomic instability and is associated with cancer development. PARP1 is not only involved in base-excision repair (BER), but also restrains replication fork progression upon replication stress. However, PARP1 has no helicase activities, and the mechanism through which PARP1 participates in the formation of reversed replication forks remains unclear. In the present study, we identified novel protein-protein interactions between PARP1 and DNA translocases, including HLTF, SHPRH, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1, with HLTF showing the strongest interaction among these DNA translocases. This finding is particularly important because PARP1 inhibitors are effective against homologous recombination deficient cancers.

For large dsDNA viruses, including tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses, immature viral DNA is recognized and translocated into a preformed icosahedral shell, the prohead. Recognition involves specific interactions between the viral packaging enzyme, terminase, and viral DNA recognition sites. Generally, viral DNA is recognized by terminase\u2019s small subunit (TerS). The large terminase subunit (TerL) contains translocation ATPase and endonuclease domains. In phage lambda, TerS binds a sequence repeated three times in cosB, the recognition site. TerS binding to cosB positions TerL to cut the concatemeric DNA at the adjacent nicking site, cosN. TerL introduces staggered nicks in cosN, generating twelve bp cohesive ends. Terminase separates the cohesive ends and remains bound to the cosB-containing end, in a nucleoprotein structure called Complex I. Complex I docks on the prohead\u2019s portal vertex and translocation ensues. DNA topology plays a role in the TerSλ-cosBλ interaction. Here we show that a site, I2, located between cosN and cosB, is critically important for an early DNA packaging step. I2 contains a complex static bend. I2 mutations block DNA packaging. I2 mutant DNA is cut by terminase at cosN in vitro, but in vivo, no cos cleavage is detected, nor is there evidence for Complex I.

Polyamines (spermine in particular) are almost exclusively bound to nucleic acids and are involved in many cellular processes that require nucleic acids. Until now, the effects of polyamines on DNA intercalator activities have remained unclear because intercalation is the most important mechanism employed by DNA-binding drugs. Herein, using actinomycin D (ACTD) as a model, we have attempted to elucidate the effects of spermine on the action of ACTD, including its DNA-binding ability, RNA and DNA polymerase interference, and its role in the transcription and replication inhibition of ACTD within cells. We found that spermine interfered with the binding and stabilization of ACTD to DNA. The presence of increasing concentrations of spermine enhanced the transcriptional and replication activities of RNA and DNA polymerases, respectively, in vitro treated with ActD. Moreover, a decrease in intracellular polyamine concentrations stimulated by methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) enhanced the ACTD-induced inhibition of c-myc transcription and DNA replication in several cancer cell lines. The results indicated that spermine attenuates ACTD binding to DNA and its inhibition of transcription and DNA replication both in vitro and within cells. Finally, a synergistic antiproliferative effect of MGBG and ACTD was observed in a cell viability assay.

The I-SceI site lies within one copy of two inactivated tandem repeated green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes (DR-GFP). A total of 2%\u20134% of the cells generated a functional GFP by homology-directed repair (HR) and gene conversion. However, ~50% of these recombinants expressed GFP poorly. Silencing was rapid and associated with HR and DNA methylation of the recombinant gene, since it was prevented in Hela cells by 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine. ES cells deficient in DNA methyl transferase 1 yielded as many recombinants as wild-type cells, but most of these recombinants expressed GFP robustly. Half of the HR DNA molecules were de novo methylated, principally downstream to the double-strand break, and half were undermethylated relative to the uncut DNA. Methylation of the repaired gene was independent of the methylation status of the converting template. The methylation pattern of recombinant molecules derived from pools of cells carrying DR-GFP at different loci, or from an individual clone carrying DR-GFP at a single locus, was comparable. ClustalW analysis of the sequenced GFP molecules in Hela and ES cells distinguished recombinant and nonrecombinant DNA solely on the basis of their methylation profile and indicated that HR superimposed novel methylation profiles on top of the old patterns. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA analysis revealed that DNA methyl transferase 1 was bound specifically to HR GFP DNA and that methylation of the repaired segment contributed to the silencing of GFP expression. Taken together, our data support a mechanistic link between HR and DNA methylation and suggest that DNA methylation in eukaryotes marks homologous recombined segments.: Genomic DNA can be modified by cytosine methylation. This epigenetic modification is layered on the primary genetic information and can silence the affected gene. Epigenetic modification has been implicated in cancer and aging. To date, the primary cause and the mechanism leading to DNA methylation are not known. By using a sophisticated genetic system, we have induced a single break in the double helix of the genomes of mouse or human cells. This rupture was repaired by a very precise mechanism: the damaged chromosome pairs and retrieves genetic information from an undamaged and homologous DNA partner. This homology-directed repair was marked in half of the repaired molecules by de novo methylation of cytosines flanking the cut. As a direct consequence, the gene in these repaired molecules was silenced. In the remaining molecules, the recombinant DNA was undermethylated and expressed the reconstituted gene. Since homology-directed repair may duplicate or delete genetic information, epigenetic modification of repaired DNA represents a powerful evolutionary force. If the expression of the repaired gene is harmful, only cells inheriting the silenced copy will survive. Conversely, if the function of the repaired gene is beneficial, cells inheriting the under-methylated copy will have a selective advantage. \"],\n        \"title_display\":\"DNA Damage, Homology-Directed Repair, and DNA Methylation\",\n        \"score\":6.319604},\n      {\n        \"id\":\"10.1371\/annotation\/254cef67-ab0e-43f6-af62-8f7df7c3677c\",\n        \"journal\":\"PLoS ONE\",\n        \"eissn\":\"1932-6203\",\n        \"publication_date\":\"2013-05-15T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"article_type\":\"Correction\",\n        \"author_display\":[\"Sheng-Yu Wang\",\n          \"Alan Yueh-Luen Lee\",\n          \"Yi-Hua Lai\",\n          \"Jeremy J.

It has been assumed that metabolism only plays a permissive role in cell division. While blocking metabolism arrests cell division, it is not known whether an up-regulation of metabolic reactions accelerates cell cycle transitions. Here, we show that increasing the amount of mitochondrial DNA accelerates overall cell proliferation and promotes nuclear DNA replication, in a nutrient-dependent manner. The Sir2p NAD+-dependent de-acetylase antagonizes this mitochondrial role. We found that cells with increased mitochondrial DNA have reduced Sir2p levels bound at origins of DNA replication in the nucleus, accompanied with increased levels of K9, K14-acetylated histone H3 at those origins. Our results demonstrate an active role of mitochondrial processes in the control of cell division. They also suggest that cellular metabolism may impact on chromatin modifications to regulate the activity of origins of DNA replication.Author Summary: How cells determine when to divide is critical for understanding biological processes where cell proliferation is manifest. Because cells need to accumulate precursors prior to duplication, cellular metabolism is expected to impact cell division. Mitochondrial processes are central to the control of overall cell metabolism. Yet, the mechanisms that link mitochondrial processes with nuclear DNA replication remain largely unknown. We found that budding yeast cells moderately over-expressing Abf2p, a mtDNA maintenance protein, accelerate nuclear DNA replication. These cells with more mitochondrial DNA proliferate and increase in size more rapidly than their wild type counterparts. The results suggest that cells over-expressing Abf2p have up-regulated metabolic functions, which in turn enable these cells to accelerate initiation of cell division. We also examined the role of Sir2p, an NAD+-dependent de-acetylase, which negatively controls DNA replication. We found that the level of Sir2p bound at origins of DNA replication is inversely related to the amount of mtDNA in the cell. In summary, our findings challenge the notion that metabolic processes are required for cell division by simply operating at constitutive background levels. Instead, our work suggests that mitochondrial transactions can actively promote DNA replication and cell division. \"],\n        \"title_display\":\"An Increase in Mitochondrial DNA Promotes Nuclear DNA Replication in Yeast\",\n        \"score\":6.1532307},\n      {\n        \"id\":\"10.1371\/journal.pone.0036125\",\n        \"journal\":\"PLoS ONE\",\n        \"eissn\":\"1932-6203\",\n        \"publication_date\":\"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"article_type\":\"Research Article\",\n        \"author_display\":[\"Sabine Hagemann\",\n          \"Dirk Kuck\",\n          \"Carlo Stresemann\",\n          \"Florian Prinz\",\n          \"Bodo Brueckner\",\n          \"Cora Mund\",\n          \"Dominik Mumberg\",\n          \"Anette Sommer\"],\n        \"abstract\":[\"\\n        Silencing of genes by hypermethylation contributes to cancer progression and has been shown to occur with increased frequency at specific genomic loci.
